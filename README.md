## Daily Warm-up Exercises for Go
#### Installation

Golang is required for these warm-ups:

```go get github.com/bertoort/go-challenges```

#### Usage

Examples are ordered alphanumerically, in the order in which they should be completed. It is expected that you are completing these warm-ups sequentially, at your own pace. To run an example, first cd into the proper directory, for example:

``cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/bertoort/go-challenges/00_functions``

Every warm-up follows the same directory structure, there will be a main file and a test file. To run the test, simply type:

``go test``

in that warm-up's root directory (in our example this is 00_functions).

#### How to Do a Warm-up

Initially, there will be a return error. Edit the main file so the function returns what is expected in the test file. Once ``go test`` returns PASS on the initial function, uncomment and repeat for the following functions until they are all complete.
